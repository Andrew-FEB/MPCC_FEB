# Boundary estimation and model predictive contouring control of an autonomous formula student race car

## Thesis description:
Once the surroundings are captured by LIDAR, mono and/or stereo camera, an algorithm has to drive the motor and steering actuator. To do this correctly, some operations still have to be done on the data. The data contain the locations of the cones, which indicate the race track. A first operation is boundary estimation, that captures the borders of the track based on the location of these cones. Next, model predictive contouring control has to calculate a racing line, as well as the speed at which the car will go through these corners. Here we must consider the grip pattern of the tires. You will have to consider a lot of dynamic aspects of the vehicle. This is knowledge that not all electronics-ICT students will have, so an introduction course will be provided to you. It is because of this that you will work closely with dynamics engineers.

## Thesis target:
We will have to develop both boundary estimation and model predictive contouring control, simulate it, test it on smaller scale and eventually implement it on the autonomous car. The thesis is more than a research topic and will eventually be used to compete in the Formula Student competions.
