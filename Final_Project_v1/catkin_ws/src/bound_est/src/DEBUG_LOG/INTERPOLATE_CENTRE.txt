Distance between current coord x(6.73239), y(3.68323) and next centre coord x(6.945), y(3.81) is 0.247534 and distance to travel till next point is 0.143122
Distance until next coord should now be 0.104412
 
This is more than the required distance, so distance to travel reduced to 0, and new coord set to x(6.85532), y(3.75653) and this point added to vector. Distance to next centre coord is 0.104412
Distance to travel at end of loop is 0
