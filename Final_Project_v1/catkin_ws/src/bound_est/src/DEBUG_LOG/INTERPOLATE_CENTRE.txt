Current centre coordinate x(26.94), y(9.74)
Distance remaining to final centre coord is 57.7689
Distance between current coord x(27.7622), y(10.002) and next centre coord x(27.85), y(10.03) is 0.0921393 and distance to travel till next point is 1.03278
Distance until next coord should now be 0
 
This is less than the required distance, so distance to travel reduced to 0.940645 and new coord set to x(27.85), y(10.03)
Distance to travel at end of loop is 0.940645

Current centre coordinate x(27.85), y(10.03)
Distance remaining to final centre coord is 57.8608
Distance between current coord x(27.85), y(10.03) and next centre coord x(28.8), y(9.995) is 0.950645 and distance to travel till next point is 0.940645
Distance until next coord should now be 0.01
 
This is more than the required distance, so distance to travel reduced to 0, and new coord set to x(28.79), y(9.99537) and this point added to vector. Distance to next centre coord is 0.01
Distance to travel at end of loop is 0
