Starting closest distance of 7.85657 at 0
Next cone with position x(4.89), y(1.24) has distance of 3.28057
This is better than previous closest distance, so new closest distance 3.28057 at index 1
Next cone with position x(2.62), y(5.39) has distance of 2.85163
This is better than previous closest distance, so new closest distance 2.85163 at index 2
Next cone with position x(-0.04), y(8.78) has distance of 6.86947
Loop ended
--------
Final cone coordinates for cone 1 are x(2.62), y(5.39) and cone 2 are x(4.89), y(1.24)
Closest point on line between line between cones and position x(5.32635), y(4.49142) calculated to be x(3.62157), y(3.55893) and slope calculated to be -1.82819
