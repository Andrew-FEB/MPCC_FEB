--------
First, finding centre coordinate closest to car position
Car has position x(47.7058), y(9.9835)
Final coordinate selected at index 39 with position x(47.7058), y(10) and distance to car of 0.016504
--------
Next, getting centre coordinates
Not enough centre coordinates with given distance. New temporary distance between points of 2.22507e-308
Centre path coordinates calculated: 
Coordinate 1 with position x(46.5134), y(9.75005)

--------
Next, getting Boundary points and slopes
Boundary path coordinates calculated with left boundary list size of 1 and right boundary list size of 1
Left position 1 with coordinate x(46.5134), y(12) and angle of 0
Right position 1 with coordinate x(46.5134), y(8) and angle of 0
Distance between these points is 4
